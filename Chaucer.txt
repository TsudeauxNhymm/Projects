                         Our Host saw well that the bright sun
        2          The ark of his artificial day hath ronne
                         The arc of his twelve-hour day has run
        3          The ferthe part, and half an houre and moore,
                         One fourth, and half an hour and more,
        4          And though he were not depe ystert in loore,
                         And though he was not far advanced in learning,
        5          He wiste it was the eightetethe day
                         He knew it was the eighteenth day
        6          Of Aprill, that is messager to May;
                         Of April, that is messenger to May;
        7          And saugh wel that the shadwe of every tree
                         And saw well that the shadow of every tree
        8          Was in lengthe the same quantitee
                         Was in length the same quantity
        9          That was the body erect that caused it.
                         As was the erect body that caused it.
        10          And therefore by the shadwe he took his wit
                         And therefore by the shadow he judged
        11          That Phebus, which that shoon so clere and brighte,

                         Five and forty degrees had climbed on height,
        13          And for that day, as in that latitude,
                         And for that day, in that latitude,
        14          It was ten of the clokke, he gan conclude,
                         It was ten o'clock, he did conclude,
        15          And sodeynly he plighte his horse aboute.
                         And suddenly he pulled his horse about.

                           Yet of the wise man take this advice:
        118          "Alle the dayes of povre men been wikke."
                           "All the days of poor men are painful."
        119          Be war, therfore, er thou come to that prikke!
                           Beware, therefore, before thou come to that point!

        120          If thou be povre, thy brother hateth thee,
                           If thou be poor, thy brother hates thee,
        121          And alle thy freendes fleen from thee, allas!
                           And all thy friends flee from thee, alas!
        122          O riche marchauntz, ful of wele been yee,

                           Your bags are not filled with double aces (a losing throw in dice),
        125          But with sys cynk, that renneth for youre chaunce;
                           But with six five, that is your winning number;

                           You seek land and sea for your winnings;

                           As wise folk you know all the condition
        129          Of regnes; ye been fadres of tidynges

                           And tales, both of peace and of war.
        131          I were right now of tales desolaat,
                           I would right now be without any tales,
        132          Nere that a marchant, goon is many a yeere,
                           Were it not that a merchant, gone by is many a year,
        133          Me taughte a tale, which that ye shal heere.
                           Taught me a tale, which you shall hear.

         
        The Man of Law's Tale

         
        Heere begynneth the Man of Lawe his tale.

         

         
        134          In Surrye whilom dwelte a compaignye
                           In Syria once dwelt a company
        135          Of chapmen riche, and therto sadde and trewe,
                           Of rich merchants, and moreover trustworthy and true,
        136          That wyde-where senten hir spicerye,
                           That wherever they sent their oriental goods,
        137          Clothes of gold, and satyns riche of hewe.
                           Cloth of gold, and satins rich in color.
        138          Hir chaffare was so thrifty and so newe
                           Their merchandise was so serviceable and so novel
        139          That every wight hath deyntee to chaffare
                           That every person has desire to trade
        140          With hem, and eek to sellen hem hire ware.
                           With them, and also to sell them their goods.

        141          Now fil it that the maistres of that sort
                           Now it happened that the masters of that company
        142          Han shapen hem to Rome for to wende;
                           Have prepared themselves to travel to Rome;
        143          Were it for chapmanhod or for disport,
                           Were it for business or for pleasure,
        144          Noon oother message wolde they thider sende,
                           No other messenger would they thither send,
        145          But comen hemself to Rome; this is the ende.
                           But came themselves to Rome; this is the sum of it.
        146          And in swich place as thoughte hem avantage
                           And in such a place as they thought advantageous
        147          For hire entente, they take hir herbergage.
                           For their purposes, they take their lodging.

        148          Sojourned han thise merchantz in that toun
                           These merchants have sojourned in that town
        149          A certein tyme, as fil to hire plesance.
                           A certain length of time, as accorded with their desires.
        150          And so bifel that th' excellent renoun
                           And it so happened that the excellent renown
        151          Of the Emperoures doghter, dame Custance,
                           Of the Emperor's daughter, Lady Custance,
        152          Reported was, with every circumstance,
                           Was reported, in full detail,
        153          Unto thise Surryen marchantz in swich wyse,
                           Unto these Syrian merchants in such a manner,
        154          Fro day to day, as I shal yow devyse.
                           From day to day, as I shall tell you.

        155          This was the commune voys of every man:
                           This was the common opinion of every man:
        156          "Oure Emperour of Rome -- God hym see! --
                           "Our Emperor of Rome -- may God look after him! --
        157          A doghter hath that, syn the world bigan,
                           A daughter has that, since the world began,
        158          To rekene as wel hir goodnesse as beautee,
                           To consider as well her goodness as beauty,
        159          Nas nevere swich another as is shee.
                           There was never such another as is she.
        160          I prey to God in honour hire susteene,
                           I pray to God to sustain her in honor,
        161          And wolde she were of al Europe the queene.
                           And would she were of all Europe the queen.

        162          "In hire is heigh beautee, withoute pride,
                           "In her is great beauty, without pride,
        163          Yowthe, withoute grenehede or folye;
                           Youth, without immaturity or folly;
        164          To alle hire werkes vertu is hir gyde;
                           In all her deeds virtue is her guide;
        165          Humblesse hath slayn in hire al tirannye.
                           Humility has slain in her all tyranny.
        166          She is mirour of alle curteisye;
                           She is mirror of all courtesy;
        167          Hir herte is verray chambre of hoolynesse,
                           Her heart is a true chamber of holiness,
        168          Hir hand, ministre of fredam for almesse."
                           Her hand, minister of generosity in giving alms."

        169          And al this voys was sooth, as God is trewe.
                           And all this opinion was true, as God is true.
        170          But now to purpos lat us turne agayn.
                           But now to the point let us turn again.
        171          Thise marchantz han doon fraught hir shippes newe,
                           These merchants have had their ships newly loaded,
        172          And whan they han this blisful mayden sayn,
                           And when they have this blissful maiden seen,
        173          Hoom to Surrye been they went ful fayn,
                           Home to Syria they have gone very happily,
        174          And doon hir nedes as they han doon yoore,
                           And they conduct their business as they have done for years,
        175          And lyven in wele; I kan sey yow namoore.
                           And live in prosperity; I can tell you no more.

        176          Now fil it that thise marchantz stode in grace
                           Now it happened that these merchants stood in the good graces
        177          Of hym that was the Sowdan of Surrye;
                           Of him that was the Sultan of Syria;
        178          For whan they cam from any strange place,
                           For when they came from any foreign place,
        179          He wolde, of his benigne curteisye,
                           He would, of his gracious courtesy,
        180          Make hem good chiere, and bisily espye
                           Entertain them well, and busily seek out
        181          Tidynges of sondry regnes, for to leere
                           News from various countries, to learn
        182          The wondres that they myghte seen or heere.
                           The wonders that they could have seen or heard.

        183          Amonges othere thynges, specially,
                           Amongst other things, specially,
        184          Thise marchantz han hym toold of dame Custance
                           These merchants have told him of Lady Custance
        185          So greet noblesse in ernest, ceriously,
                           Such great noble qualities in earnest, in detail,
        186          That this Sowdan hath caught so greet plesance
                           That this Sultan has caught such great desire
        187          To han hir figure in his remembrance,
                           To have her figure in his remembrance,
        188          That al his lust and al his bisy cure
                           That all his desire and all his intense concern
        189          Was for to love hire while his lyf may dure.
                           Was to love her while his life may endure.

        190          Paraventure in thilke large book
                           Perhaps in that large book
        191          Which that men clepe the hevene ywriten was
                           Which men call the heaven was written
        192          With sterres, whan that he his birthe took,
                           In stars, when he was born,
        193          That he for love sholde han his deeth, allas!
                           That he because of love should have his death, alas!
        194          For in the sterres, clerer than is glas,
                           For in the stars, clearer than is glass,
        195          Is writen, God woot, whoso koude it rede,
                           Is written, God knows, whoever could read it,
        196          The deeth of every man, withouten drede.
                           The death of every man, without doubt.

        197          In sterres, many a wynter therbiforn,
                           In stars, many a winter before then,
        198          Was writen the deeth of Ector, Achilles,
                           Was written the death of Hector, Achilles,
        199          Of Pompei, Julius, er they were born;
                           Of Pompey, Julius, before they were born;
        200          The strif of Thebes; and of Ercules,
                           The strife of Thebes; and of Hercules,
        201          Of Sampson, Turnus, and of Socrates
                           Of Sampson, Turnus, and of Socrates
        202          The deeth; but mennes wittes ben so dulle
                           The death; but men's wits are so dull
        203          That no wight kan wel rede it atte fulle.
                           That no person can well interpret it fully.

        204          This Sowdan for his privee conseil sente,
                           This Sultan for his privy council sent,
        205          And, shortly of this matiere for to pace,
                           And, to pass briefly over this matter,
        206          He hath to hem declared his entente,
                           He has to them declared his intent,
        207          And seyde hem, certein, but he myghte have grace
                           And said to them, certainly, unless he could have the good fortune
        208          To han Custance withinne a litel space,
                           To have Custance within a little time,
        209          He nas but deed; and charged hem in hye
                           He was as good as dead; and ordered them hastily
        210          To shapen for his lyf som remedye.
                           To arrange some remedy to save his life .

        211          Diverse men diverse thynges seyden;
                           Different men said different things;
        212          They argumenten, casten up and doun;
                           They argue, consider alternatives;
        213          Many a subtil resoun forth they leyden;
                           Many a subtle argument they laid forth;
        214          They speken of magyk and abusioun.
                           They speak of magic and deception.
        215          But finally, as in conclusioun,
                           But finally, in conclusion,
        216          They kan nat seen in that noon avantage,
                           They can not see any advantage in that,
        217          Ne in noon oother wey, save mariage.
                           Nor in any other way, save for marriage.

        218          Thanne sawe they therinne swich difficultee
                           Then saw they in that such difficulty
        219          By wey of reson, for to speke al playn,
                           By way of reason, to speak all plainly,
        220          By cause that ther was swich diversitee
                           Because there was such difference
        221          Bitwene hir bothe lawes, that they sayn
                           Between their two religions, that they say
        222          They trowe that no "Cristen prince wolde fayn
                           They suppose that no "Christian prince would be willing
        223          Wedden his child under oure lawe sweete
                           To wed his child under our sweet religion
        224          That us was taught by Mahoun, oure prophete."
                           That was taught us by Mohammed, our prophet."

        225          And he answerde, "Rather than I lese
                           And he answered, "Rather than I lose
        226          Custance, I wol be cristned, doutelees.
                           Custance, I will be christened, doubtless.
        227          I moot been hires; I may noon oother chese.
                           I must be hers; I can choose no other.

        343          And I shal make us sauf for everemoore?"
                           And I shall make us safe for evermore?"

        344          They sworen and assenten, every man,
                           They swore and agree, every man,

        348          And she hath this emprise ytake on honde,
                           And she has this enterprise taken in hand,
        349          Which ye shal heren that I shal devyse,
                           Which you shall hear as I shall tell,

                           And to them all she spoke right in this manner:

        351          "We shul first feyne us cristendom to take --
                           "We shall first pretend to receive Christendom --
        352          Coold water shal nat greve us but a lite! --
                           Cold water shall not grieve us but a little! --
        353          And I shal swich a feeste and revel make
                           And I shall such a feast and revel make
        354          That, as I trowe, I shal the Sowdan quite.
                           That, as I believe, I shall pay back the Sultan.
        355          For thogh his wyf be cristned never so white,
                           For though his wife be christened never so white,
        356          She shal have nede to wasshe awey the rede,
                           She shall have need to wash away the red,
        357          Thogh she a font-ful water with hire lede."
                           Though she a baptismal font full of water bring with her."

        387          In Surrye, with a greet solempne route,
                           In Syria, with a great solemn company,
        388          And hastifliche this Sowdan sente his sonde
                           And hastily this Sultan sent his messenger
        389          First to his mooder, and al the regne aboute,
                           First to his mother, and all the reign about,
        390          And seyde his wyf was comen, out of doute,
                           And said his wife was come, without doubt,

                           The honor of his reign to sustain.

        393          Greet was the prees, and riche was th' array
                           Large was the crowd, and rich was the assembly
        394          Of Surryens and Romayns met yfeere;
                           Of Syrians and Romans met together;
        395          The mooder of the Sowdan, riche and gay,
                           The mother of the Sultan, richly dressed and gay,

        398          And to the nexte citee ther bisyde
                           And to the nearest city there beside

                           At a slow pace solemnly they ride.

        400          Noght trowe I the triumphe of Julius,
                           I do not believe the triumph of Julius,
        401          Of which that Lucan maketh swich a boost,
                           Of which Lucan makes such a boastful account,
        402          Was roialler ne moore curius
                           Was more royal nor more splendid
        403          Than was th' assemblee of this blisful hoost.
                           Than was the assembly of this blissful host.
        404          But this scorpioun, this wikked goost,
                           But this scorpion, this wicked spirit,
        405          The Sowdanesse, for al hire flaterynge,
                           The Sultaness, for all her flattering,
        406          Caste under this ful mortally to stynge.
                           Planned, under cover of this, very mortally to sting.

        407          The Sowdan comth hymself soone after this
                           The Sultan comes himself soon after this
        408          So roially that wonder is to telle,
                           So royally that it is a wonder to tell,
        409          And welcometh hire with alle joye and blis.
                           And welcomes her with all joy and bliss.
        410          And thus in murthe and joye I lete hem dwelle;
                           And thus in mirth and joy I let them remain;
        411          The fruyt of this matiere is that I telle.
                           The essential part of this matter is what I tell.
        412          Whan tyme cam, men thoughte it for the beste
                           When time came, men thought it for the best
        413          That revel stynte, and men goon to hir reste.
                           That revel should stint, and people go to their rest.

        414          The tyme cam, this olde Sowdanesse
                           The time having come, this old Sultaness
        415          Ordeyned hath this feeste of which I tolde,
                           Has arranged this feast of which I told,
        416          And to the feeste Cristen folk hem dresse
                           And to the feast Christian folk go
        417          In general, ye, bothe yonge and olde.
                           All together, yes, both young and old.
        418          Heere may men feeste and roialtee biholde,
                           Here may men behold feasting and royalty,
        419          And deyntees mo than I kan yow devyse;
                           And dainties more than I can tell you;
        420          But al to deere they boghte it er they ryse.
                           But all too dear they paid for it before they rise (from the feast).

                           O sudden woe, that ever art successor
        422          To worldly blisse, spreynd with bitternesse,
                           To worldly bliss, sprinkled with bitterness,

                           The end of the joy of our worldly labor!
        424          Wo occupieth the fyn of oure gladnesse.
                           Woe takes over at the end of our gladness.
        425          Herke this conseil for thy sikernesse:
                           Hearken to this counsel for thy safety:

                           The unexpected woe or harm that follows.

        428          For shortly for to tellen, at o word,
                           For shortly to tell, at one word,
        429          The Sowdan and the Cristen everichone
                           The Sultan and the Christians each one
        430          Been al tohewe and stiked at the bord,
                           Are all hacked to pieces and stabbed at the table,
        431          But it were oonly dame Custance allone.
                           Except for only Lady Custance alone.
        432          This olde Sowdanesse, cursed krone,
                           This old Sultaness, cursed crone,
        433          Hath with hir freendes doon this cursed dede,
                           Has with her friends done this cursed deed,
        434          For she hirself wolde al the contree lede.
                           For she herself wanted to rule all the country.

        435          Ne ther was Surryen noon that was converted,
                           Nor there was any Syrian that was converted,
        436          That of the conseil of the Sowdan woot,
                           Who knew of the counsel of the Sultan (followed his advice),
        437          That he nas al tohewe er he asterted.
                           Who was not all hacked to pieces before he could escape.
        438          And Custance han they take anon, foot-hoot,
                           And Custance have they taken right then, immediately,
        439          And in a ship al steerelees, God woot,
                           And in a ship entirely without a rudder, God knows,
        440          They han hir set, and bidde hire lerne saille
                           They have set her, and told her to learn to sail
        441          Out of Surrye agaynward to Ytaille.
                           Out of Syria back to Italy.

        442          A certein tresor that she thider ladde,
                           A certain amount of treasure that she brought there,
        443          And, sooth to seyn, vitaille greet plentee
                           And, to say the truth, a great store of provisions
        444          They han hire yeven, and clothes eek she hadde,
                           They have given her, and clothes also she had,
        445          And forth she sailleth in the salte see.
                           And forth she sails in the salt see.
        446          O my Custance, ful of benignytee,
                           O my Custance, full of goodness,
        447          O Emperoures yonge doghter deere,
                           O Emperor's young daughter dear,
        448          He that is lord of Fortune be thy steere!
                           He that is lord of Fortune be thy rudder!

        449          She blesseth hire, and with ful pitous voys
                           She blesses herself, and with full pitiful voice
        450          Unto the croys of Crist thus seyde she:
                           Unto the cross of Christ thus said she:

        564          Lest that hir housbonde, shortly for to sayn,
                           Lest that her husband, shortly to say,
        565          Wolde hire for Jhesu Cristes love han slayn,
                           Would have slain her for Jesus Christ's love,
        566          Til Custance made hire boold, and bad hire wirche
                           Until Custance made her bold, and told her to work
        567          The wyl of Crist, as doghter of his chirche.
                           The will of Christ, as daughter of his church.

        568          The constable weex abasshed of that sight,
                           The constable grew troubled at that sight,
        569          And seyde, "What amounteth al this fare?"
                           And said, "What does all this business mean?"
        570          Custance answerde, "Sire, it is Cristes myght,
                           Custance answered, "Sir, it is Christ's might,
        571          That helpeth folk out of the feendes snare."
                           That helps folk out of the fiend's snare."
        572          And so ferforth she gan oure lay declare
                           And so completely she did our religion explain
        573          That she the constable, er that it was eve
                           That she the constable, before it was evening,
        574          Converteth, and on Crist made hym bileve.
                           Converts, and made him believe in Christ.

        575          This constable was nothyng lord of this place
                           This constable was in no way lord of this place
        576          Of which I speke, ther he Custance fond,
                           Of which I speak, where he Custance found,
        577          But kepte it strongly many a wyntres space
                           But kept it securely many a winter's space of time
        578          Under Alla, kyng of al Northhumbrelond,
                           Under Alla, king of all Northumberland,
        579          That was ful wys, and worthy of his hond
                           Who was full wise, and worthy of his hand (a mighty warrior)
        580          Agayn the Scottes, as men may wel heere;
                           Against the Scots, as men may well hear;
        581          But turne I wole agayn to my mateere.
                           But I will turn again to my subject.

        582          Sathan, that evere us waiteth to bigile,
                           Satan, that ever waits (for a chance) to trick us,
        583          Saugh of Custance al hire perfeccioun,
                           Saw of Custance all her perfection,
        584          And caste anon how he myghte quite hir while,
                           And considered right away how he might repay her,
        585          And made a yong knyght that dwelte in that toun
                           And made a young knight that dwelt in that town
        586          Love hire so hoote, of foul affeccioun,
                           Love her so passionately, by foul desire,
        587          That verraily hym thoughte he sholde spille,
                           That truly he thought he should die,
        588          But he of hire myghte ones have his wille.
                           Unless he might once have his will of her.

        589          He woweth hire, but it availleth noght;
                           He woos her, but it avails not;
        590          She wolde do no synne, by no weye.
                           She would do no sin, in no way.
        591          And for despit he compassed in his thoght
                           And for malice he plotted in his mind
        592          To maken hire on shameful deeth to deye.
                           To make her in a shameful death to die.
        593          He wayteth whan the constable was aweye,
                           He waits until the constable was away,
        594          And pryvely upon a nyght he crepte
                           And secretly one night he crept
        595          In Hermengyldes chambre, whil she slepte.
                           In Hermengild's bedroom, while she slept.

        596          Wery, forwaked in hire orisouns,
                           Weary, exhausted because of her prayers,
        597          Slepeth Custance, and Hermengyld also.
                           Sleeps Custance, and Hermengild also.
        598          This knyght, thurgh Sathanas temptaciouns,
                           This knight, through Satan's temptations,
        599          Al softely is to the bed ygo,
                           Very quietly has gone to the bed,
        600          And kitte the throte of Hermengyld atwo,
                           And cut the throat of Hermengild in two,
        601          And leyde the blody knyf by dame Custance,
                           And laid the bloody knife by Lady Custance,
        602          And wente his wey, ther God yeve hym meschance!
                           And went his way, may God give him misfortune!

        603          Soone after cometh this constable hoom agayn,
                           Soon after, this constable comes home again,
        604          And eek Alla, that kyng was of that lond,
                           And also Alla, who was king of that land,
        605          And saugh his wyf despitously yslayn,
                           And saw his wife mercilessly slain,
        606          For which ful ofte he weep and wroong his hond,
                           For which full often he wept and wrung his hands,
        607          And in the bed the blody knyf he fond
                           And in the bed the bloody knife he found
        608          By Dame Custance. Allas, what myghte she seye?
                           By Lady Custance. Alas, what could she say?
        609          For verray wo hir wit was al aweye.
                           For sheer woe her wit was all away.

        610          To kyng Alla was toold al this meschance,
                           To king Alla was told all this misfortune,
        611          And eek the tyme, and where, and in what wise
                           And also the time, and where, and in what manner
        612          That in a ship was founden this Custance,
                           That in a ship was found this Custance,
        613          As heer-biforn that ye han herd devyse.
                           As before this you have heard tell.
        614          The kynges herte of pitee gan agryse,
                           The king's heart for pity trembled,
        615          Whan he saugh so benigne a creature
                           When he saw so good a creature
        616          Falle in disese and in mysaventure.
                           Fallen in distress and in misfortune.

        617          For as the lomb toward his deeth is broght,
                           For as the lamb toward its death is brought,
        618          So stant this innocent bifore the kyng.
                           So stands this innocent before the king.
        619          This false knyght, that hath this tresoun wroght,
                           This false knight, who has this treason wrought,
        620          Berth hire on hond that she hath doon thys thyng.
                           Falsely testifies that she has done this thing.
        621          But nathelees, ther was greet moornyng
                           But nonetheless, there was great mourning
        622          Among the peple, and seyn they kan nat gesse
                           Among the people, and they say they can not imagine
        623          That she had doon so greet a wikkednesse,
                           That she had done so great a wickedness,

        624          For they han seyn hire evere so vertuous,
                           For they have seen her always so virtuous,
        625          And lovynge Hermengyld right as hir lyf.
                           And loving Hermengild as much as her life.
        626          Of this baar witnesse everich in that hous,
                           Of this bore witness every one in that house,
        627          Save he that Hermengyld slow with his knyf.
                           Except for him who slew Hermengild with his knife.
        628          This gentil kyng hath caught a greet motyf
                           This gentle king was deeply moved
        629          Of this witnesse, and thoghte he wolde enquere
                           By this witness, and thought he would enquire
        630          Depper in this, a trouthe for to lere.
                           Deeper in this, to learn the truth.

        631          Allas! Custance, thou hast no champioun,
                           Alas! Custance, thou hast no champion,
        632          Ne fighte kanstow noght, so weylaway!
                           And fight can thou not, alas!
        633          But he that starf for our redempcioun,
                           But He that died for our redemption,
        634          And boond Sathan (and yet lith ther he lay),
                           And bound Satan (and he yet lies where he lay),
        635          So be thy stronge champion this day!
                           So be thy strong champion this day!
        636          For, but if Crist open myracle kithe,
                           For, unless Christ a clear miracle reveals,
        637          Withouten gilt thou shalt be slayn as swithe.
                           Without guilt thou shalt be slain immediately.

                           She set herself down on knees, and thus she said:

                           "Immortal God, that savedest Susannah

                           Amongst all the faces in that route?
        651          So stant Custance, and looketh hire aboute.

        1008         Custances sone wente in his compaignye.
                           Custance's son went in his company.

        1009         Som men wolde seyn at requeste of Custance
                           Some men would say at request of Custance
        1010         This senatour hath lad this child to feeste;
                           This senator has led this child to the feast;
        1011         I may nat tellen every circumstance --
                           I can not tell every detail --
        1012         Be as be may, ther was he at the leeste.
                           Be as be may, there he was at the least.
        1013         But sooth is this, that at his moodres heeste
                           But the truth is this, that at his mother's command
        1014         Biforn Alla, durynge the metes space,
                           Before Alla, during the meal time,
        1015         The child stood, lookynge in the kynges face.
                           The child stood, looking in the king's face.

        1016         This Alla kyng hath of this child greet wonder,
                           This king Alla has of this child great wonder,
        1017         And to the senatour he seyde anon,
                           And to the senator he said at once,
        1018         "Whos is that faire child that stondeth yonder?"
                           "Whose is that fair child that stands yonder?"
        1019         "I noot," quod he, "by God, and by Seint John!
                           "I do not know," said he, "by God, and by Saint John!
        1020         A mooder he hath, but fader hath he noon
                           A mother he has, but father has he none
        1021         That I of woot" -- and shortly, in a stounde,
                           That I know of" -- and shortly, in a little while,
        1022         He tolde Alla how that this child was founde.
                           He told Alla how this child was found.

        1023         "But God woot," quod this senatour also,
                           "But God knows," said this senator also,
        1024         "So vertuous a lyvere in my lyf
                           "So virtuous a liver in my life
        1025         Ne saugh I nevere as she, ne herde of mo,
                           Saw I never as she, nor heard of more,
        1026         Of worldly wommen, mayde, ne of wyf.
                           Of worldly women, maiden, nor of wife.
        1027         I dar wel seyn hir hadde levere a knyf
                           I dare well say she had rather have a knife
        1028         Thurghout hir brest, than ben a womman wikke;
                           Through her breast, than be a woman wicked;
        1029         There is no man koude brynge hire to that prikke."
                           There is no man could bring her to that point."

        1030         Now was this child as lyk unto Custance
                           Now was this child as like unto Custance
        1031         As possible is a creature to be.
                           As it is possible for a creature to be.
        1032         This Alla hath the face in remembrance
                           This Alla has the face in remembrance
        1033         Of dame Custance, and ther on mused he
                           Of Lady Custance, and thereon mused he
        1034         If that the childes mooder were aught she
                           If the child's mother were in any way she
        1035         That is his wyf, and pryvely he sighte,
                           Who is his wife, and secretly he sighed,
        1036         And spedde hym fro the table that he myghte.
                           And sped himself from the table as fast as he could.

        1037         "Parfay," thoghte he, "fantome is in myn heed!
                           "In faith," thought he, "hallucination is in my head!
        1038         I oghte deme, of skilful juggement,
                           I ought to believe, by reasonable judgment,
        1039         That in the salte see my wyf is deed."
                           That in the salt sea my wife is dead."
        1040         And afterward he made his argument:
                           And afterward he made his contrary argument:
        1041         "What woot I if that Crist have hyder ysent
                           "What know I if Christ has hither sent
        1042         My wyf by see, as wel as he hire sente
                           My wife by sea, as well as he her sent
        1043         To my contree fro thennes that she wente?"
                           To my country from thence that she went?"

        1044         And after noon, hoom with the senatour
                           And after noon, home with the senator
        1045         Goth Alla, for to seen this wonder chaunce.
                           Goes Alla, to see this wonderful happening.
        1046         This senatour dooth Alla greet honour,
                           This senator does Alla great honor,
        1047         And hastifly he sente after Custaunce.
                           And hastily he sent after Custance.
        1048         But trusteth weel, hire liste nat to daunce
                           But trust well, she did not want to dance
        1049         Whan that she wiste wherfore was that sonde;
                           When she knew the reason for that summons;
        1050         Unnethe upon hir feet she myghte stonde.
                           Hardly upon her feet she could stand.

        1051         Whan Alla saugh his wyf, faire he hire grette,
                           When Alla saw his wife, gently he greeted her,
        1052         And weep that it was routhe for to see;
                           And wept that it was a pity to see;
        1053         For at the firste look he on hire sette
                           For at the first look he on her set
        1054         He knew wel verraily that it was she.
                           He knew well indeed that it was she.
        1055         And she, for sorwe, as doumb stant as a tree,
                           And she, for sorrow, stands as dumb as a tree,
        1056         So was hir herte shet in hir distresse,
                           So was her heart shut (pressed by emotion) in her distress,
        1057         Whan she remembred his unkyndenesse.
                           When she remembered his unnatural cruelty.

        1058         Twyes she swowned in his owene sighte;
                           Twice she swooned in his own sight;
        1059         He weep, and hym excuseth pitously.
                           He wept, and himself excuses piteously.
        1060         "Now God," quod he, "and his halwes brighte
                           "Now God," said he, "and his saints bright
        1061         So wisly on my soule as have mercy,
                           As surely as they may have mercy on my soul,
        1062         That of youre harm as giltelees am I
                           (I swear) that of your harm I am as guiltless
        1063         As is Maurice my sone, so lyk youre face;
                           As is Maurice my son, whose face is so like yours;
        1064         Elles the feend me fecche out of this place!"
                           Otherwise (may) the fiend me fetch out of this place!"

        1065         Long was the sobbyng and the bitter peyne,
                           Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain,
        1066         Er that hir woful hertes myghte cesse;
                           Before their woeful hearts might cease (giving pain);
        1067         Greet was the pitee for to heere hem pleyne,
                           Great was the pity to hear them lament,
        1068         Thurgh whiche pleintes gan hir wo encresse.
                           Through which lamentations began their woe to increase.
        1069         I pray yow alle my labour to relesse;
                           I pray you to release me from all my labor;
        1070         I may nat telle hir wo until to-morwe,
                           I can not tell their woe until to-morrow,
        1071         I am so wery for to speke of sorwe.
                           I am so weary from speaking of sorrow.

        1072         But finally, whan that the sothe is wist
                           But finally, when the truth is known
        1073         That Alla giltelees was of hir wo,
                           That Alla was guiltless of her woe,
        1074         I trowe an hundred tymes been they kist,
                           I believe a hundred times they have kissed,
        1075         And swich a blisse is ther bitwix hem two
                           And such a bliss is there between them two
        1076         That, save the joye that lasteth everemo,
                           That, except for the joy that lasts evermore,
        1077         Ther is noon lyk that any creature
                           There is none like it that any creature
        1078         Hath seyn or shal, whil that the world may dure.
                           Has seen or shall (see), while the world may endure.

        1079         Tho preyde she hir housbonde mekely,
                           Then prayed she her husband meekly,
        1080         In relief of hir longe, pitous pyne,
                           In relief of her long, pitiful pain,
        1081         That he wolde preye hir fader specially
                           That he would pray her father specially
        1082         That of his magestee he wolde enclyne
                           That of his majesty he would incline
        1083         To vouche sauf som day with hym to dyne.
                           To grant some day with him to dine.
        1084         She preyde hym eek he sholde by no weye
                           She prayed him also he should by no means
        1085         Unto hir fader no word of hire seye.
                           Unto her father say any word of her.

        1086         Som men wolde seyn how that the child Maurice
                           Some men would say that the child Maurice
        1087         Dooth this message unto this Emperour;
                           Takes this message unto this Emperor;
        1088         But, as I gesse, Alla was nat so nyce
                           But, as I guess, Alla was not so foolish
        1089         To hym that was of so sovereyn honour
                           To him that was of such high honor
        1090         As he that is of Cristen folk the flour,
                           As he that is of Christian folk the flower,
        1091         Sente any child, but it is bet to deeme
                           To have sent any child, but it is better to believe
        1092         He wente hymself, and so it may wel seeme.
                           He went himself, and that would be most fitting.

        1093         This Emperour hath graunted gentilly
                           This Emperor has agreed nobly
        1094         To come to dyner, as he hym bisoughte;
                           To come to dinner, as he him requested;
        1095         And wel rede I he looked bisily
                           And well read I (in my source) he looked intently
        1096         Upon this child, and on his doghter thoghte.
                           Upon this child, and thought about his daughter.
        1097         Alla goth to his in, and as hym oghte,
                           Alla goes to his inn, and as he should,
        1098         Arrayed for this feste in every wise
                           Prepared for this feast in every way
        1099         As ferforth as his konnyng may suffise.
                           So far as his ability may suffice.

        1100         The morwe cam, and Alla gan hym dresse,
                           The morning came, and Alla began to prepare himself,
        1101         And eek his wyf, this Emperour to meete;
                           And also his wife, to meet this Emperor;
        1102         And forth they ryde in joye and in gladnesse.
                           And forth they ride in joy and in gladness.
        1103         And whan she saugh hir fader in the strete,
                           And when she saw her father in the street,
        1104         She lighte doun, and falleth hym to feete.
                           She dismounted, and falls to his feet.
        1105         "Fader," quod she, "youre yonge child Custance
                           "Father," said she, "your young child Custance
        1106         Is now ful clene out of youre remembrance.
                           Is now completely out of your remembrance.

        1107         "I am youre doghter Custance," quod she,
                           "I am your daughter Custance," said she,
        1108         "That whilom ye han sent unto Surrye.
                           "Whom long ago you have sent unto Syria.
        1109         It am I, fader, that in the salte see
                           It am I, father, that in the salt sea
        1110         Was put allone and dampned for to dye.
                           Was put alone and damned to die.
        1111         Now, goode fader, mercy I yow crye!
                           Now, good father, mercy I beg of you!

                           But thank my lord here of his kindnesses."

        1114         Who kan the pitous joye tellen al
                           Who can tell all the pitiful joy

                           Between them three, since they are thus met?
        1116         But of my tale make an ende I shal;

                           The day goes fast, I will no longer delay.
        1118         This glade folk to dyner they hem sette;
